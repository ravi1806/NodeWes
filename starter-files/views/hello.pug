	.wrapper.classone
		//- Indentations are used to nest, #{} used to render the variable to text.
		//- we can write js in pug files usin - sign
		- const upDog = dog.toUpperCase();
		p.classtwo Hello my dog name is #{upDog}!!!
		//- we could have used inline js too like #{dog.toUpperCase()}!!
		span#idName Yo!
		img(src="dog.jpg" alt="Dog image") 
	//- inside the attributes eg. image's alt we have to write ${dog} inside es6 template strings to render its name, #{} wont work in atts
